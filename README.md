Project Description
MOTIVASH is an Android app that helps you stay focused and productive by tracking your screen time, setting custom limits for apps, and blocking distractions once limits are reached. With built-in math challenges for extra time requests, it encourages mindful and intentional app usage.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are losing hours of their lives to an evil cabal of cat videos, endless meme scrolling, and that one ‚Äújust five more minutes‚Äù rabbit hole that somehow eats half the day. Society is on the brink ‚Äî productivity is crashing, snacks are mysteriously disappearing, and our thumbs are developing six-packs from endless swiping. We knew we had to act‚Ä¶



The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre tackling distractions by turning discipline into a game!
MOTIVASH keeps you on track by setting screen time limits, blocking sneaky apps when you‚Äôve had enough, and making you earn extra time with quick math challenges  because if you can‚Äôt solve it, you can‚Äôt scroll it!

This screen welcomes new users to the MOTIVASH app and introduces its core purpose‚Äîhelping users take control of digital habits by setting limits, blocking distractions, and boosting motivation.

This screen allows users to select which installed apps they want to block or restrict. Users can check apps from the available list that tend to be distracting, and set healthy usage limits for each.

When users try to extend their app usage time, this screen presents a math challenge. They must solve three problems (like 513 √∑ 19) to unlock additional time, adding a fun friction point to prevent impulsive usage.
